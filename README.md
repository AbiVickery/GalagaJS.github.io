# GalagaJS.github.io
 attempt at a Galaga game made with JavaScript
 This and the flappy repository are just 2 of the few ideas of what kind of game im going to make for my next IO project
 This isn't really anything official, this is just something I am making for fun because I want to and because I can!
 Here is the link (just know that some changes may not load right away and this site is still a work in progress!!!):
